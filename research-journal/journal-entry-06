Journal Entry 06

Monday 20 June 2016

 Added access control to Syntax.hs, Parser.hs, TypeCheck.hs. This was a by-product of wanting to create test cases inside Main.hs and needing access to type constructors not explicitly imported by Main.hs.

 Encountering a stack overflow error when testing certain terms. Parsing terms and types seems to work just fine. It might be a problem with how I am giving lambda abstractions to input (mainCheck).

 13:00 meeting. Realized that errors in Main.hs were from giving STDIN literal strings versus normal STDIN. Parser.hs was understandably struggling with " " in input. mainCheck and mainEval seem to behave.

 Spent time on category theory questions, especially on natural transformations, posets as categories, and commutative diagrams as proofs. Need to leave early for anniversary prep.

Week of 13 June 2016
Journal Entry 05

Reading Ch.3 and re-reading Ch.2 of category theory book.
Reviewed SystemT lecture implementation of evaluator.

Monday 13 June 2016:

 Made changes to Eval.hs. I'm a little unsure of what cases I need to cover from the evaluation rules. Obviously we want to handle Beta redux and recursion. Do we need to implement evaluation rules for a rule like t1 ~> t1' / app t1 t2 ~> app t1' t2?

 Finish Evaluator and typePres. Have questions about typePres: calling runTypeChecker requires a Ctx to be passed to it. Should I create a helper function (i.e typePres' :: Term -> Ctx -> Bool
     typePres' tm ctx = typePres ... 		) 
 Will ask these questions during weekly meeting today.

 Post-meeting & session conclusion: Fixed some Haskell errors in TypeCheck.hs. Fixed logic error in Eval.hs. TypeCheck.hs and Eval.hs should be complete now.

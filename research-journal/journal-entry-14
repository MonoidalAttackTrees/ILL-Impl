Monday 5 September

	Experimentation with monads, specifically IO, StateT, REPL monads.

Tuesday 6 September

	Removed dead code, unnecessary data constructors. Reviewed and started type construction rules.

Wednesday 7 September 2016

	When building type checker for LetU (let *), realized that syntax/parser may need adjustment. Do we really need to take in two -terms-? The first input should just be a variable as it is substituting for a known term, *. 

Thursday 8 September 2016

	Progress on type construction. Modified LetT syntax, printer, parser to accomodate type annotation. Type construction for tensor terms, let unit* (must discuss), application, lolly/lambda, var, implemented.

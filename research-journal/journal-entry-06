Journal Entry 06

Monday 20 June 2016

 Added access control to Syntax.hs, Parser.hs, TypeCheck.hs. This was a by-product of wanting to create test cases inside Main.hs and needing access to type constructors not explicitly imported by Main.hs.

 Encountering a stack overflow error when testing certain terms. Parsing terms and types seems to work just fine. It might be a problem with how I am giving lambda abstractions to input (mainCheck).

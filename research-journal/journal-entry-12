	Reworking Syntax to DILL. Including comments/annotations where appropriate for discussion at meeting on Tuesday.

Questions:
 1. Var vs Constant (aside obvious difference)
 2. Delta ; _ |- ... (meaning of '_')
 3. 3rd Let type: LetBang.
 4. Include Type information in LetT (tensor let)?

Began work on new parsers, constant up first.

Tuesday 23 August 2016

	First attempts at the constant parser was not so good. It took me a while to realize that a term expression that is a constant might be ambiguous when parsed. Maybe I need to implement a better syntax, or find a clever way to recognize a constant. Maybe ordering it after parser ... <|> var <|> try constParse

	Rough constant parser in repo, but ambiguity is still a problem. I'm going to look at the other parsers instead of wasting time messing with the const parser.

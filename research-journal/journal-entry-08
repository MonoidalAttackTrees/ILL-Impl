Week #8

Tuesday 5 July 2016

   Work continues on pretty printer and parser. Only case that remains is LetT. Almost there. I know we have a lolly type, but do we need to have a lolly term? ex. if I know f :: A -o B, should I have a term f = a -o b where a, b are Terms of type A, B respectively?

   Or is the lambda abstraction always of the type lolly A -o B?
   - Yes

   Removed irrelevant references to RecCalc.

Wednesday 6 July 2016

   Added parens case for App, Lolly, Lam to avoid incorrect parsing. Change of derive machinery in Syntax.hs not implemented yet.

Thursday 7 July 2016

   Addressed final parens issue in Pretty Printer, primarily App case. Syntax.hs and Pretty.hs are complete (barring any issue in testing once Parser is done).

   LetT case in Parser remains, testing begins.

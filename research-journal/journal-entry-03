Research Journal Entry 03

I learned that I had misunderstood the distinctions between type checking, type construction, and type inference. Besides the obvious differences in natural language, my approach to RecCalc's TypeCheck.hs was insufficient as I viewed typeCheck as a checker, not as a construction algorithm.

An anticipated confusion has manifested: the types of Haskell versus the types of the PL I am implementing. Must be more clear and concise when thinking/talking about these types.


Q: Question about parser in TypeCheck.hs, specifically function tmCtxParse and Parsec. Not necessary to complete project, just a curiosity.
A: ?

25 Monday 2016

   Studying more monads. I want to get a better understanding of de-sugared 'do' notation in Grady. I understand bind, return, sequencing and the like, just not reflexively or intuitively. Specifically, get/put in Repl.

   Tried using a variation of queue map, map, fold to achieve printing global variables. No luck, just some frustration.

   Continuing to experiment with fold, map, map queue, and recursion to print global vars like GHC/GHCi.

28 Thursday 2016

   Resolved issues in printing global variables in queue. Still need to determine best error handling method (currently undefined). I feel better about using get/put and how/why they work.

Trouble with unbind and complying with type constraints. Not sure where to look for help with this.

I ran into minor case issues when case splitting over a term in Rec t0 t1 t2. I want to ensure that t2 has T -> Nat -> T, so I want to run 
 case t2 of 
  (Arr (Arr T1 Nat) T1) -> return ...

but Haskell doesn't like that case.

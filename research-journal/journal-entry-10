   Changing parser for tensors from infix notation to a prefix notation. Keeping printer printing (x). Adapting test cases for new tensor notation. Working on LetI, U on switching pattern and input. Encountered some problems in parsing tens term. Parser wants to use "tens" as a variable name and the following terms as an application.

   Still having issues with new tensor parser. Pattern-first LetT should be working okay except for the tensor. Should we change how the user enters a pattern in for LetT?

   Migrated tensor to prefix notation after meeting with Dr. Eades. Updated printer to match parsing convention. Resolved pattern change in LetT terms.

   Studied grady's Repl, Functional Queue implementation, Repl additions to parser, Haskeline documentation, related monad concepts.

   Implemented basic repl with small tweaks. Work in progress.
   Expanded Repl, tweaked parser. Thinking about functionality I want to add (like grady's let, but an alternative?)
